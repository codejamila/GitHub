    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <h2>Hard Drives</h2>
 <h3>SSD</h3>
 <p>Solid-state drives (SSDs) are the most common storage drives today. SSDs are smaller and faster than hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are noiseless and allow PCs to be thinner and more lightweight. Hard disk drives (HDDs) are more common in older devices.</p>
<h3>HDD RAM</h3>
  <p>
    A computer hard disk drive (HDD) is a non-volatile data storage device. Non-volatile refers to storage devices that maintain stored data when turned off. All computers need a storage device, and HDDs are just one example of a type of storage device.</p>
    <h3>DDR2</h3>
    <p>
       The DDR2 is essentially an upgraded version of the DDR standard that allows for memory modules with lower power consumption, greater heat dissipation, increased speed capabilities, larger memory capacities, and increased performance.</p>
    <h3>DDR3</h3>
    <p>
        The term DDR3 is an acronym for Double Data Rate version 3. It is a crucial type of third-gen SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory), mainly used as a type of system memory. The DDR3 can easily transfer data and info from one location to the other at a very high speed.</p>
    <h3>DDR4</h3>
    <p>
        DDR4 RAM has higher overall speed. It gives you increased transfer rates and less voltage which means less overall power consumption. DDR4 RAM cuts back voltage by 40% and boosts performance and bandwidth by 50% as compared to DDR3.</p>

        <h1>London</h1>
        <p>London is also unique in the UK as a result of its high population, diverse economy and capital city status. This means London has transport and infrastructure demands that are not comparable with any other city, or indeed region, in the UK.</p>
